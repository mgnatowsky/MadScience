# MadScience
MadScience, a full-on, first-time experiment
-- The following is my first readme edit on GitHub. --
I have just completed an extended contract and found your opportunity on CareerBuilder.

I am a senior technical writer, editor, and team leader with 30+ years’ experience in writing and editing for publication/production in most documentation outputs and styles. These include technical (including UI/API/SDK and requirements), non-technical, system architecture and end-user material. I also have 20+ years' experience in managing documentation and e-learning projects of all sizes and complexity. 

My experience and skills as a consultant or a direct hire have enabled companies of all sizes to raise the user/customer-facing presentation of their products and services to a superior level of quality and sophistication for both internal and external customers – within budget and on schedule.

On the document project management front, I have established, led and participated, employing solid communication skills, high-productivity plans, established styles and standards, and produced goal/project timeframe estimates, for just a few examples.

I am available at your convenience and would love to discuss this opportunity at your convenience anytime!
Thank you for your consideration and have a great weekend!
